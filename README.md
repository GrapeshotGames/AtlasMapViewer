# (Experimental) Atlas Map Viewer
![Alt text](Example1.jpg?raw=true "Exmaple1")
Used as an example to read ship and bed positions from Redis overlayed on top of a world and territory or colonies map.  It consists of two pieces, a go web service that retrieves and serves the ship and bed positions and a simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) / [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) app.

The slippy map tiles for the world are generated by [ServerGridEditor](https://github.com/GrapeshotGames/ServerGridEditor) and should be placed in the "www/tiles" directory.

## Go Dependencies:
* go 1.12 using modules

## Setup
### Web Service
#### Command Line
The web service requires the same ServerGrid.json and ServerGrid.ServerOnly.json as the Atlas game servers.  You can either copy those two files into the same directory as AtlasWebViewer.exe or use the command line ```-atlas path_to_game_server_config_directory```.
#### Config
The default config.json should work out of the box.
```
{
    //Can be left blank but usually just ip of hosting machine in simple case 
    "Host": "",
	
    //Port to host the web service
    "Port": 8880,
	
    //Optional link to territory server
    "TerritoryURL": "http://localhost:8881/territoryTiles/",
	
    //Relative path to the static web files
    "StaticDir": "./www",

    //Disable sending commands to the game server
    "DisableCommands": true,
	
    //Frequency entities such as ships and beds are polled from Redis.
    // A negative value disables the feature.
    "EntityFetchRateInSeconds": 300,
	
    //Frequency island information is polled from Redis
    // A negative value disables the feature.
    "ColonyFetchRateInSeconds": 900,
}
```
Note: The config.json stays relative to binary path.

### Web App
The client file "www/config.js" holds some cluster specific information like the grid size.
```
const config = {
    // Enable requesting of territory tiles.  To work, the AtlasTerritoryMap services needs to be running.
    EnableTerritory: false,

    // Enable requesting of colony information.
    EnableColonies: true,

    //Number of columns in the grid
    ServersX: 15,
	
    // Number of rows in the grid
    ServersY: 15,
	
    //Command completion suggestion
    Suggestions: [
        "spawnshipfast name",
        "spawnbed name",
        "destroyall",
    ]
}
```
